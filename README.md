## Overview
Los Angeles is a large commuter city which inherently lends itself to numerous traffic collisions. 
Car crashes are one of the leading causes of death in the US(1) and as such they are a candidate for study. Studying a leading cause of death may unveil insights which may help prevent or reduce deaths due to traffic collisions.


## Step 1: Finalize Idea and Logistics
 
Objective: Analyze data from LA County database regarding traffic collisions in LA County.
<br>
We will create a dashboard page with multiple graphs updating from the same data. This faciliated visual analyzation of the data.

## Step 3: Store data in database
We will utilize SQLite

## Step 4: Create Dashboard page with graphs
Dashboard Page

    3 graphs
        
        Heat map 
            Collision rates by    geography
            Collision rates by sex
            etc
        
        Accident Particulars vs city population(vs age range of drivers)
        
        Time dependent analysis of accidents 
            Vs time of year
            Vs time of day 
            VS day of week

        Add'l ideals
